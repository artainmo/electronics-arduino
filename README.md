Electronics project, that uses Arduino to:
- Measure temperature, humidity with DHT22
- Display with 16X2 LCD
- Maintain a certain humidity with grove water atomization


PREPARE SOFTWARE
Install arduino IDE: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software
Open arduino IDE with main.cpp.ino
Sketch -> include libraries -> liquidcrystal
Sketch -> include libaraies -> include .zip -> DHTlib.zip
Verify -> see if compilation succeeds

PREPARE HARDWARE
Connect prepared arduino to computer
Upload arduino code on it

CAUTION
Do not touch grove water atomizer middle part
